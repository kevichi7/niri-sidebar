# niri-sidebar

A lightweight, external sidebar manager for the [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) window manager.

`niri-sidebar` allows you to toggle any window into a "floating sidebar" stack on the right side of your screen. It automatically handles resizing, positioning, and stacking, keeping your main workspace clean while keeping utility apps (terminals, music players, chats) accessible.

## Features

- **Toggle Windows:** Instantly move the focused window into the sidebar stack.
- **Auto-Stacking:** Windows automatically stack vertically with a configurable gap.
- **Smart Close:** Closing a sidebar window automatically reorders the remaining windows to fill the gap.
- **Flip & Hide:** Flip the stack to the other side of the screen or hide it completely (peeking mode).
- **State Persistence:** Remembers your sidebar windows and their original sizes even if you restart the tool.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Binary (Recommended)

1.  Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Vigintillionn/niri-sidebar/releases) page.
2.  Download the `niri-sidebar` binary.
3.  Make it executable and move it to your path:

```bash
chmod +x niri-sidebar
sudo mv niri-sidebar /usr/local/bin/
# OR
mv niri-sidebar ~/.local/bin/
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vigintillionn/niri-sidebar
cd niri-sidebar
cargo build --release
cp target/release/niri-sidebar ~/.local/bin/
```

## Niri configuration

Add the following bindings to your niri `config.kdl` file.

**Important:** These examples assume you installed the tool to `~/.local/bin`. If you installed it elsewhere, update the paths accordingly.

```kdl
binds {
    // Toggle the focused window into/out of the sidebar
    Mod+S { spawn-sh "~/.local/bin/niri-sidebar toggle-window"; }

    // Toggle sidebar visibility (hide/show)
    Mod+Shift+S { spawn-sh "~/.local/bin/niri-sidebar toggle-visibility"; }

    // Flip the order of the sidebar
    Mod+Ctrl+S { spawn-sh "~/.local/bin/niri-sidebar flip"; }

    // Force reorder (useful if something gets misaligned manually)
    Mod+Alt+R { spawn-sh "~/.local/bin/niri-sidebar reorder"; }
}
```

In order for your sidebar to stay consistent and gap free, you want to add the following to your startup scripts

```kdl
spawn-at-startup "~/.local/bin/niri-sidebar" "listen"
```

This will spawn a daemon to listen for window close events and reorder the sidebar if the closed window was part of it.

Some applications enforce a minimum window size that is larger than your sidebar configuration, which can cause windows to overlap or look broken. Add this rule to force them to respect the sidebar size:

```kdl
window-rule {
    match is-floating=true
    min-width 100
    min-height 100
}
```

## Configuration

Run `niri-sidebar init` to generate a `config.toml` file located at `~/.config/niri-sidebar`.

#### Default Config

```toml
# niri-sidebar configuration

[geometry]
# Width of the sidebar in pixels
width = 400
# Height of the sidebar windows
height = 335
# Gap between windows in the stack
gap = 10

[margins]
# Space from the top/bottom of the screen
top = 50
# Space from the right edge of the screen
right = 10

[interaction]
# Width of windows when sidebar is hidden in pixels
peek = 10
# Width of window when sidebar is hidden but window is focused in pixels
# set this equal to peek to disable this feature
# set this equal to sidebar_width + offset_right to make focused windows "unhide"
focus_peek = 50
```

## Workflow tips

- **Adding/Removing:** Press `Mod+S` on any window to snap it into the sidebar. Press it again to return it to your normal tiling layout.
- **Hiding:** Press `Mod+Shift+S` to tuck the sidebar away. It will stick out slightly (configured by peek) so you know it's there.
